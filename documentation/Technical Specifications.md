# 5. SYSTEM DESIGN

## 5.1 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application will utilize the following programming languages:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| JavaScript (ES6+) | Frontend development (React) | Modern syntax, wide browser support, and seamless integration with React ecosystem |
| TypeScript | Backend development (Node.js) | Static typing for improved code quality and maintainability |
| SQL | Database queries and management | Standard language for relational database operations with PostgreSQL |
| HTML5 | Frontend structure | Latest standard for web content structure |
| CSS3 | Frontend styling | Modern styling capabilities, including flexbox and grid layouts |

## 5.2 DATABASE DESIGN

The application will use PostgreSQL as the primary database. The database schema is designed to support the core functionalities of order management, inventory tracking, and user authentication.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Order : manages
    User {
        int id PK
        string username
        string email
        string password_hash
        string role
        datetime last_login
    }
    Order ||--|{ OrderItem : contains
    Order {
        int id PK
        string shopify_order_id UK
        datetime order_date
        string status
        string shipping_address
        string tracking_number
    }
    OrderItem {
        int id PK
        int order_id FK
        int product_id FK
        int quantity
    }
    Product ||--o{ OrderItem : "is in"
    Product ||--o{ InventoryItem : "has"
    Product {
        int id PK
        string shopify_product_id UK
        string name
        string sku UK
        string barcode UK
    }
    InventoryItem {
        int id PK
        int product_id FK
        int quantity
        string location
        datetime last_updated
    }
```

Key considerations for the database design:

1. Use of foreign keys to maintain referential integrity
2. Indexing on frequently queried columns (e.g., shopify_order_id, sku, barcode)
3. Implementation of database constraints to ensure data validity
4. Use of UUID for certain IDs to facilitate potential future data migration or integration
