# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims to develop a comprehensive web-based Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application for an e-commerce store operating on Shopify. The client faces challenges in efficiently managing inventory and streamlining the order fulfillment process, which are critical for maintaining customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Our proposed solution addresses these pain points by providing a seamless integration between the client's Shopify store, inventory management system, and shipping processes.

The application will:
1. Automatically pull and categorize unfulfilled orders from Shopify
2. Determine order fulfillment feasibility based on real-time inventory levels
3. Facilitate a streamlined fulfillment process using barcode scanning technology
4. Generate shipping labels via Sendle API integration
5. Update Shopify orders and inventory levels in real-time

## OBJECTIVES

1. Automate order management to reduce manual errors and save time
2. Optimize inventory control to prevent stockouts and overstock situations
3. Streamline the fulfillment process to increase efficiency and reduce processing time
4. Improve accuracy in order picking and packing through barcode scanning
5. Enhance visibility into unfulfillable orders to inform restocking decisions
6. Seamlessly integrate with existing Shopify and Sendle systems
7. Provide a user-friendly interface to improve staff productivity

## BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

While we have made every effort to provide an accurate and comprehensive budget, there are several areas of uncertainty or risk that could impact the final project cost:

1. **Scope Changes**: Any significant changes to the project scope after the requirements phase could lead to additional development time and costs. We will manage this through a formal change request process, where any scope changes will be evaluated for their impact on the budget and timeline.

2. **API Integration Complexities**: While we have experience with Shopify and Sendle APIs, unforeseen complexities or changes in their APIs could require additional development time. We have included a buffer in our estimates to account for this, but significant changes may impact the budget.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Depending on the volume of orders and inventory items, additional optimization work may be required to meet performance requirements. This could involve additional development time or infrastructure costs.

4. **Security Requirements**: If additional security measures are required beyond our standard practices (e.g., specific compliance requirements), this could impact both development time and infrastructure costs.

5. **Testing and Bug Fixes**: While we have allocated time for QA and testing, complex edge cases or integration issues could require additional time to resolve.

6. **Client Hardware Compatibility**: If the client's existing hardware (barcode scanners, computers) requires additional development work for compatibility, this could impact the budget.

7. **AWS Infrastructure Costs**: The costs for AWS services are estimates based on typical usage. Actual costs may vary depending on the application's usage patterns and data volume.

To manage these uncertainties:

1. We have included a 10% contingency in the budget to cover minor overruns or unexpected costs.
2. We will provide regular budget updates throughout the project and flag any potential overruns early.
3. We will work closely with the client to prioritize features if budget constraints become an issue.
4. We will conduct thorough testing early in the development process to identify any potential issues that could impact the budget.

By maintaining open communication and proactive management of these considerations, we aim to deliver the project within the proposed budget while meeting all key requirements and quality standards.

The critical path tasks are:

1. Requirements Gathering: Ensuring all stakeholder needs are captured accurately.
2. Design: Creating a robust system architecture and intuitive UI/UX.
3. Development Sprint 1: Implementing core Order Management functionality.
4. Development Sprint 2: Implementing Inventory Management and API integrations.
5. Testing: Thorough testing of all features and integrations.
6. Deployment: Successful launch of the application in the production environment.
7. Project Closure: Final documentation and handover to the client.

To maintain the project schedule, special attention will be given to these critical path items:

- Regular progress checks and risk assessments will be conducted for each critical task.
- Resources will be allocated prioritizing critical path tasks.
- Any potential delays in these tasks will be immediately escalated and addressed.
- Parallel non-critical tasks will be managed to avoid resource conflicts with critical path items.

By closely monitoring and managing these critical path elements, we aim to ensure timely delivery of the Inventory Management and Fulfillment Application within the proposed 5-month timeline.
